It was decided that we would have the lobbyists retained through \\nthe Government Affairs group.  Two recent agreements, one with Quantum \\nResults and another with Tripp, Scott, provided for payments to be made at \\ncertain junctures of our development process.  It has come to our attention \\nthat these payments were not timely made.   In order to make sure that we \\ndon't inadvertently miss any future payments, I am proposing that:\\n\\n1.  We continue to retain the consultants through execution of a consulting \\nservices agreement signed by Government Affairs.  The consulting agreements \\nwill be prepared in duplicate originals so that the lobbyist keeps one copy \\nand Enron keeps one copy.\\n\\n2.  Legal will retain Enron's executed original and provide it to Kay Young, \\nwho maintains a database of all consulting agreements and confidentiality \\nagreements entered into by ENA entities.\\n\\n3.  Legal will distribute a copy of the executed document to government \\naffairs for their records.\\n\\n4.  Legal will distribute a copy of the executed document to Kathleen \\nCarnahan who will set up a payment schedule.  Unlike our real property option \\nagreements that have a date certain for payment, these agreements often have \\npayment schedules dependent upon some approval process.  Thus, it will be \\nimportant for all of us to keep Kathleen in the loop as to dates of hearings \\nor approvals so that she will know if it is time for a payment.\\n\\n5.  Kathleen will provide notices to government affairs that a payment is \\ndue, and the amount of the payment and arrange for reimbursement of such \\npayment out of the development group's RC.\\n\\n6.  Government affairs will make the payments and be reimbursed out of the \\ndevelopment group's RC.  \\n\\nPlease advise if this system will work for you so that we can undertake to \\nhave Kathleen begin setting up a payment schedule.\\n\\nMy strong preference is that we continue to keep things flowing through the \\ngovernment affairs group so that we consistently maintain the lobbyist \\nrelationship.  However, this will require government affairs have some way of \\nmonitoring the agreements.  I think we fix that problem with having Kathleen \\nkeep a consultant schedule just as she keeps an option schedule.\\n\\nI'm going on vacation as of next Wednesday so your response by Tuesday will \\nbe greatly appreciated.\\n  \n",

He has just come off a road trip and had a chance to read my \\ntelefax.  Vanek will apparently send me some of the documentation I \\nrequested, although it is not clear that he will send me the documents that \\nreflect that all the loads for which Scottsborough is being sued were in fact \\npurchased from MG Metals.\\n\\nMy last question on my telefax to Vanek was what attorney Vanek would \\ntypically retain in a lawsuit such as this to defend Scottsborough.  Vanek \\nsaid in his voice-mail that in this suit, he does not intend to hire an \\nattorney.  Vanek said he would pay whatever the carrier was suing for, then \\ndeduct that amount from whatever Scottsborough owes us for aluminum.  Then, \\ncontradicting himself, Vanek said that he would join MG Metals as a party \\n(which would of course require him to retain an attorney).  I assume that he \\nprobably could join us as a party on a breach of contract theory, given that \\nScottsborough purchased the metal from us \"freight prepaid\".   I'm not sure \\nthat an Alabama court has personal jurisdiction over Enron Metals sufficient \\nto allow joinder, but it might.\\n\\nVanek also seemed irritated at the time MG Metals had taken to reply to his \\nearlier communications, and directed me to our Montreal office if I wanted \\ncopies of things he had previously sent to us.  Of course, we all decided \\nsome time ago to take a \"let sleeping dogs lie\" strategy in hopes that a \\ncarrier like Alabama wouldn't actually file suit.  In any case, I don't know \\nhow much of this apparent irritation is real or is strategy.\\n\\nI called Vanek back and again missed him, but left a voice-mail to the effect \\nthat I read his message \"loud and clear\" and would jump on reviewing the \\nexhibits he was sending me as soon as I received them.

It was decided that we would have the lobbyists retained through \\nthe Government Affairs group.  Two recent agreements, one with Quantum \\nResults and another with Tripp, Scott, provided for payments to be made at \\ncertain junctures of our development process.  It has come to our attention \\nthat these payments were not timely made.   In order to make sure that we \\ndon't inadvertently miss any future payments, I am proposing that:\\n\\n1.  We continue to retain the consultants through execution of a consulting \\nservices agreement signed by Government Affairs.  The consulting agreements \\nwill be prepared in duplicate originals so that the lobbyist keeps one copy \\nand Enron keeps one copy.\\n\\n2.  Legal will retain Enron's executed original and provide it to Kay Young, \\nwho maintains a database of all consulting agreements and confidentiality \\nagreements entered into by ENA entities.\\n\\n3.  Legal will distribute a copy of the executed document to government \\naffairs for their records.\\n\\n4.  Legal will distribute a copy of the executed document to Kathleen \\nCarnahan who will set up a payment schedule.  Unlike our real property option \\nagreements that have a date certain for payment, these agreements often have \\npayment schedules dependent upon some approval process.  Thus, it will be \\nimportant for all of us to keep Kathleen in the loop as to dates of hearings \\nor approvals so that she will know if it is time for a payment.\\n\\n5.  Kathleen will provide notices to government affairs that a payment is \\ndue, and the amount of the payment and arrange for reimbursement of such \\npayment out of the development group's RC.\\n\\n6.  Government affairs will make the payments and be reimbursed out of the \\ndevelopment group's RC.  \\n\\nPlease advise if this system will work for you so that we can undertake to \\nhave Kathleen begin setting up a payment schedule.\\n\\nMy strong preference is that we continue to keep things flowing through the \\ngovernment affairs group so that we consistently maintain the lobbyist \\nrelationship.  However, this will require government affairs have some way of \\nmonitoring the agreements.  I think we fix that problem with having Kathleen \\nkeep a consultant schedule just as she keeps an option schedule.\\n\\nI'm going on vacation as of next Wednesday so your response by Tuesday will \\nbe greatly appreciated.\\n</td>\n",

He has just come off a road trip and had a chance to read my \\ntelefax.  Vanek will apparently send me some of the documentation I \\nrequested, although it is not clear that he will send me the documents that \\nreflect that all the loads for which Scottsborough is being sued were in fact \\npurchased from MG Metals.\\n\\nMy last question on my telefax to Vanek was what attorney Vanek would \\ntypically retain in a lawsuit such as this to defend Scottsborough.  Vanek \\nsaid in his voice-mail that in this suit, he does not intend to hire an \\nattorney.  Vanek said he would pay whatever the carrier was suing for, then \\ndeduct that amount from whatever Scottsborough owes us for aluminum.  Then, \\ncontradicting himself, Vanek said that he would join MG Metals as a party \\n(which would of course require him to retain an attorney).  I assume that he \\nprobably could join us as a party on a breach of contract theory, given that \\nScottsborough purchased the metal from us \"freight prepaid\".   I'm not sure \\nthat an Alabama court has personal jurisdiction over Enron Metals sufficient \\nto allow joinder, but it might.\\n\\nVanek also seemed irritated at the time MG Metals had taken to reply to his \\nearlier communications, and directed me to our Montreal office if I wanted \\ncopies of things he had previously sent to us.  Of course, we all decided \\nsome time ago to take a \"let sleeping dogs lie\" strategy in hopes that a \\ncarrier like Alabama wouldn't actually file suit.  In any case, I don't know \\nhow much of this apparent irritation is real or is strategy.\\n\\nI called Vanek back and again missed him, but left a voice-mail to the effect \\nthat I read his message \"loud and clear\" and would jump on reviewing the \\nexhibits he was sending me as soon as I received them.  I told him that I was \\nparticularly interested in them because if the bs/l were marked \"freight \\nprepaid\", then Scottsborough may have a good defense to the carrier's case.\\n\\nAs you may recall, ICTS has been joined as a party to this action.  ICTS is \\nthe party that didn't pay the carrier.  I try to call ICTS and see what it \\nintends to do in this matter.   \\n\\nBritt</td>\n",

National Fuel transferred 1,000,000 dth from our parking contract \\nto our brand new firm storage contract.  We are now long FSS and short PALS. \\n\\nFSS\\n We have the rights to withdraw on a firm basis up to 33,333 dth per day.  \\nHowever, we need to call and get permission to withdraw more than 33,333 dth \\non any given day.  Also, the withdrawal takes place at an interconnect, like \\nTrco-Leidy.  We do not have to ship the gas on Nat Fuel.  \\n\\nIAS\\nWe give Nat Fuel the gas back on an IT basis via our IAS agreement (Nat Fuel \\nis still setting up the contracts).  We can give Nat Fuel the gas back at any \\npoint we wish.  We do not have to pay back the gas at the same point we \\nwithdraw on the FSS.  And we can pay back the gas before we withdraw it.\\n\\nCOST\\nWhat we will probably do most of the time is take the FSS into Trco at Leidy \\nand payback the IAS agreement at Niagara and Leidy.  ENA will pay Nat Fuel \\n1,000,000 dth x ($.125 / 3 months) or $41,666.67 per month for June, July, \\nand August.  This deal is over on Aug 31st.  I just entered the demand charge \\non my Market East demand charge sheet.  I do not have any deals set up in \\nSitara.  I need to see the contracts from Nat Fuel first.  I will keep track \\nof the balances on an Excel worksheet.  All commodity cost and fuel is \\ncapured in the $.125 demand charge.  Beavy and I will make sure the payback \\nand withdrawal tickets are balanced in Sitara once we start flowing gas on \\nthis deal.  If we payback 60,000 dth next week and we do not have any \\nwithdrawals, then I will show a 60,000 dth withdrawal on 8/31/2000 just to \\nkeep the tickets balanced.\\n\\nPayback Techniques\\nUnder the expert eye of the wonderfull, superfantastic, all-around great guy, \\nDick Jenkins, I've come up with some options on paying back the gas.\\n\\nNiagara - only works when Niagara is open.  Nat Fuel has been very close to \\ncapacity this week.  However, we should always see what Martin can do with \\nthe gas if it gets backed up into TCPL.  OR if Niagara is constrained, we can \\nship the gas on our firm Nat Fuel contract then pay it back to Nat Fuel, at \\ntoday's prices that cost about $.105\\n\\nWadd - take our Tenn Z6 length into CNG via Iroq, ship it to Trco- Leidy, and \\npayback the gas at Leidy.  At today's prices, that cost about  $.055, \\nassuming we get to roll over all of our CNG fuel waivers.\\n\\nTenn -   we just need to see what type of IT rate Dan can get to ship the \\nGulf to Tenn Z4 (Ellisburgh).  We can also move the Dracutt to Nat Fuel on \\nsegmented capacity for $.145 or  move Wright to Nat Fuel for $.11.  We cannot \\nuse the Net 284 contract on any of the Tenn / Nat Fuel interconnects.\\n\\nLet me know if you have any questons.\\n\\n\",\n          \"Message-ID: <1586395.1075852530427.JavaMail.evans@thyme>\\nDate: Wed, 18 Jul 2001 07:16:05 -0700 (PDT)\\nFrom: mike.grigsby@enron.com\\nTo: m..tholt@enron.com\\nSubject: FW: SF Gate News Special California's Energy Crisis\\nMime-Version: 1.0\\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii\\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit\\nX-From: Grigsby, Mike </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=MGRIGSB>\\nX-To: Tholt, Jane M. </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Jtholt>\\nX-cc: \\nX-bcc: \\nX-Folder: \\\\JTHOLT (Non-Privileged)\\\\Tholt, Jane M.\\\\JANIE\\nX-Origin: Tholt-J\\nX-FileName: JTHOLT (Non-Privileged).pst\\n\\n \\n-----Original Message-----\\nFrom: Mike & Courtney Grigsby [mailto:mgrigsby@swbell.net]\\nSent: Tuesday, July 17, 2001 9:18 PM\\nTo: Grigsby, Mike\\nSubject: SF Gate News Special California's Energy Crisis\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n  <http://www.sfgate.com/news/special/pages/2001/energycrisis/> \",\n          \"Message-ID: <9254582.1075857593923.JavaMail.evans@thyme>\\nDate: Tue, 28 Mar 2000 03:34:00 -0800 (PST)\\nFrom: john.arnold@enron.com\\nTo: matthew.arnold@enron.com\\nSubject: Re:\\nMime-Version: 1.0\\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii\\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit\\nX-From: John Arnold\\nX-To: Matthew Arnold\\nX-cc: \\nX-bcc: \\nX-Folder: \\\\John_Arnold_Dec2000\\\\Notes Folders\\\\Sent\\nX-Origin: Arnold-J\\nX-FileName: Jarnold.nsf\\n\\nclub seats extra wide extra leg room  extra waitresses  \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

(This includes <br>agreement, queue, facilities if needed, etc.)  Call us if you need <br>assistance.  Thanks.<br><br><br>   <br><br><br><br>Attached is FERC authorization for EPMI and EES to purchase power from <br>industrials NATIONWIDE (effective March 6, 2001--Does not expire).  The <br>industrial does not have to obtain its own power marketer license from FERC <br>(subject to EPMI and EES making certain after the fact quarterlty filings for <br>the industrials). <br><br>Specifics:<br><br>Owners of generating facilities located at business locations and used <br>primarily for back-up for self-generation (who will be \"public utilities\" <br>subject to the Federal Power Act only while they sell at wholesale) can sell <br>power at wholesale from such facilities to EPMI and EES without prior notice <br>under section 205 of FPA (would usually require 60 day advance notice <br>filing).  <br>  -- Waives certain parts of the filing requirements for the industrial; <br>however, the industrial will still be subject to shortened filing <br>requirements for dispositions of facilities and interlocking positions while <br>they are selling at wholesale.<br> -- EPMI and EES will make the FERC quarterly filings on behalf of the <br>industrials for any of these purchases.  Our report must show the names of <br>the industrial; aggregate amount of capacity and/or energy purchased from <br>each seller; and the aggregate compensation paid to each seller.  <br>Accounting/commercial folks for EPMI and EES-- please make sure these <br>purchases are flagged in the accounting system, since the report will be <br>separate from our big quarterly reports.<br> -- This does not authorize the retail industrial customer to violate any <br>rules or tariffs of its host utility.  This does not authorize an industrial <br>to resell power it purchases (only can sell what it generates); unless <br>otherwise allowed (or not precluded) by its retail tariff.<br><br>West Desk:  This is similar to the authorization that FERC gave last week to <br>purchases from industrials in WSCC.<br><br><br>____________________________________<br>On April 27, FERC issued an order granting EPMI and EES the authority to <br>purchase power from IPPs at market-based rates.

        "- **Masked Output Summary**:\n",
        "  - All direct personal identifiers (names, addresses, emails) were successfully masked, achieving perfect precision and recall.\n",
        "  - **Edge Case Handling**:\n",
        "    - Indirect references such as \"near the big park\" and \"just off [PERSONAL]\" were effectively masked, preserving context without compromising anonymity.\n",
        "    - However, the name \"Hope Fields\" at the end of the message might suggest a missed edge case, particularly as it appears in a general salutation, where it could be identifiable.\n",

        "### Example 2:\n",
        "- **Precision**: `0.83`, **Recall**: `0.83`, **Score**: `9`\n",
        "- **Masked Output Summary**:\n",
        "  - Major personal identifiers, including names, addresses, and contact details, were masked effectively.\n",
        "  - **Edge Case Handling**:\n",
        "    - The phrase \"Green’s Groceries\" could potentially link back to the individual’s last name, \"Green,\" highlighting a missed edge case with names that also serve as common nouns.\n",
        "    - An opportunity was missed to mask the non-standard address format (\"Near North Industrial Area\"), which could inadvertently reveal a location.\n",
        "    - **Conclusion**: While precision and recall were high, this example underscores the importance of handling indirect identifiers, especially names that overlap with common words.\n",

        "### Example 3:\n",
        "- **Precision**: `0.60`, **Recall**: `0.60`, **Score**: `6`\n",
        "- **Masked Output Summary**:\n",
        "  - Some personal identifiers, such as specific dates and parts of addresses, were masked, but masking was inconsistent.\n",
        "  - **Edge Case Handling**:\n",
        "    - Non-standard address format (\"near [PERSONAL], Apt B\") and specific medical identifiers, like \"Dr. Mark T. Howell\" and \"SecureCare Insurance,\" were not masked, exposing potential privacy risks.\n",
        "    - Location-based descriptions, like \"located near the lake,\" were also missed, posing a subtle risk when combined with other identifiable items.\n",
        "    - **Conclusion**: The system struggled with indirect or partially identifiable terms, resulting in lower recall and the potential exposure of critical personal information.\n",

        "  - Direct identifiers were generally well-masked across examples, achieving high precision.\n",
        "  - Handling of edge cases varied, with challenges in masking common words used as names, non-standard addresses, and subtle indirect references.\n",

        "#### 1. Best Parameters:\n",
        "   - **Temperature**: `0.5` provided balanced and consistent outputs, ensuring predictability and reliability in masking without generating overly variable responses.\n",
        "   - **Max Tokens**: `512` was sufficient to cover standard documents and ensure complete masking across examples.\n",
        "   - **Top P**: `1.0`, **Frequency Penalty**: `0.1`, and **Presence Penalty**: `0.2` worked best together, reducing repetition and improving precision without overly restricting the model’s flexibility.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 2. Best Strategy:\n",
        "   - **Strategy 1: Contextual Examples for Masking** proved most effective across diverse examples, especially with clear prompts guiding the masking process based on real-world examples.\n",
        "   - This strategy excelled in:\n",
        "     - **Directly identifiable information masking**: Masked explicit details like names, addresses, and emails accurately.\n",
        "     - **Contextual clues**: Retained non-sensitive, general information while effectively identifying indirectly identifiable information.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 3. Key Improvements:\n",
        "   - Strategies that included **specific instructions** on handling indirect identifiers (e.g., common words as names, non-standard addresses) improved accuracy.\n",
        "   - **Precision** was generally high, but **recall** varied with indirect references, indicating a need for fine-tuning to enhance edge case handling.\n",
